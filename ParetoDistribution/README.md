# Essential Statistics for Data Science: The Pareto Distribution

## Viewing the Jupyter notebook

Just in case you don't want to bother with Jupyter right now, you will find the notebook rendered as an HTML file [here](./html/Essential%20Statistics%20For%20Data%20Science%20-%20The%20Pareto%20Distribution.html).

If you want to execute the code in the Jupter notebook from the lesson, you may follow the instructions from the following sections.

## How to Install Jupyter Notebook

### Windows and Mac OS

The easiest way to have Jupyter notebooks up and running in your machine is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Anaconda already includes Python (just be sure that you download the Python 3 version).

After the installation, you should have a Jupyter notebook icon in your Windows start menu or in your Mac OS dock, but may also open a terminal and execute the following command:

    jupyter notebook

Anaconda is also supported on Linux by the way, but it includes many other tools that you might not need at the moment. If you want to be minimalistic, follow the instructions in the next section.

### Linux Ubuntu

I'm assuming that you already have Python 3 installed in your computer.

- Update Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

- Install IPython:

```
sudo apt-get -y install ipython ipython-notebook
```

- Install Jupyter:

```
    sudo -H pip install jupyter
```

- Start Jupyter:

```
    jupyter-notebook
```

The Jupyter notebook will start your default browser and open a page where you can browse for folders or notebook files.

## How to Download this Project

### Manually

Just in case you are not familiar with Git and don't want to bother with it at the moment.

- Click the button "Clone or Dowload" and then "Download ZIP":

- Unzip the file to a local folder.

- Start Juptyter and browse to the folder with the unzipped contents.

- Click `Statistics For Data Scientists - Distributions.ipynb`.

You're all set.

### Using Git

- On a terminal, execute the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/marciogualtieri/EssentialStatisticsForDataScience.git
```

- Natigate to the project's folder:

```
cd EssentialStatisticsForDataScience
```

- Click `Statistics For Data Scientists - Distributions.ipynb`.

You're all set.
